        <p>My background is as a criminal lawyer and not technology, however they both require an attention to detail and organisation skills.</p>
        <p>An important element of my job was listening to the various parties, to grasp what they understood of the process, and what they hoped to achieve. <br>As a Web Developer, understanding what the client's wants and understands, will be a key component of the job</p>
         <p>I grew up in northern BC, and left to start university in Vancouver. I then left and moved the UK</p>
        <p>I returned to education and completed a law degree, then qualified as a barrister. <br>I returned to Canada where i qualified as a lawyer there but returned to the UK within 3 years</p>  
        <p>I practised for a number of years before stopping work to concentrate on my sons' education</p>
        <p>I have done voluntary work in the community in various forms</p>
